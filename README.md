## Hello world ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in **statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and big data processing**. 

The unique knowledge combination between **business** and **data science** makes me a **well-rounded data scientist** capable of working effectively with both **business teams** and **technical teams** or in another word, **bridging the gap between business strategy and data science**.

Please find my latest projects' repositories below, feel free to read, fork, and play around with it!
