## ğŸ‘‹ Hello World!  

Iâ€™m a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in **statistical analysis**, **predictive modeling**, and **big data processing**.  
With a unique blend of **business knowledge** and **technical expertise**, I bridge the gap between **business strategy** and **data science**, making me a well-rounded data professional.

Below are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on â€” feel free to explore, fork, and interact!
